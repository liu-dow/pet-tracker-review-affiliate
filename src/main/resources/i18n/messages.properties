subscription.faq.title=Frequently Asked Questions About Pet Tracker Subscriptions
subscription.faq.q1=What is a pet tracker subscription and how does it work?
subscription.faq.a1=A pet tracker subscription is a recurring fee that allows your GPS pet tracker to connect to cellular networks and provide real-time location data. Most GPS pet trackers require a monthly subscription for data connectivity. Popular brands like Tractive, Fi, and Pawfit offer various subscription plans ranging from $3 to $12 per month.
subscription.faq.q2=Why do pet trackers need subscriptions? What about the SIM card?
subscription.faq.a2=Pet GPS trackers require subscriptions because they contain embedded SIM cards that connect to cellular networks, similar to smartphones. This connectivity enables real-time location tracking, geofencing, and activity monitoring. The business model differs from item finders like Apple AirTag, which use Bluetooth and the crowd-sourced Find My network without monthly fees. GPS pet trackers provide continuous, precise location data anywhere with cell coverage, which requires ongoing data transmission costs covered by subscription fees. The embedded SIM card allows the device to communicate with cellular towers, sending location data to servers that you access through mobile apps. Without an active subscription, the SIM card loses network access, rendering the GPS tracking features unusable. This subscription-based model ensures consistent revenue for companies to maintain network infrastructure, provide customer support, and develop new features.
subscription.faq.q3=Which pet tracker has the cheapest subscription?
subscription.faq.a3=Based on our comparison, Kippy offers some of the most affordable long-term subscription plans starting at €3.33/month for a 5-year commitment. However, the best value depends on your specific needs, features required, and contract length preferences.
subscription.faq.q4=Are there pet trackers without monthly fees?
subscription.faq.a4=Yes, some pet trackers don't require monthly subscriptions. Apple AirTag works with the Find My network without subscription fees but offers limited features compared to GPS trackers. PitPat offers a one-time device purchase with optional membership plans.
subscription.faq.q5=What features are typically included in pet tracker subscriptions?
subscription.faq.a5=Most pet tracker subscriptions include real-time GPS tracking, location history, geofencing/virtual fences, and activity monitoring. Premium plans often include additional features like health monitoring, extended location history, worldwide coverage, and family sharing options.
