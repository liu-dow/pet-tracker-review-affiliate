                <h2>Important Notice</h2>
                <p>
                    PetTrackerReview.com participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may earn
                    commissions
                    from purchases made through links on our website. This disclosure is made in accordance with the
                    Federal Trade
                    Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in
                    Advertising."

                <h2>What This Means</h2>
                <p>
                    When you click on certain links on our website and make a purchase, we may receive a small
                    commission at no
                    additional cost to you. These affiliate partnerships help support our website and allow us to
                    continue providing
                    free, valuable content about pet trackers and related products.

                <h2>Our Editorial Independence</h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be completely transparent with our readers: while we do earn commissions from some of the
                    products
                    we recommend, this does not influence our editorial content. Our reviews, comparisons, and
                    recommendations are
                    based on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thorough research and testing</li>
                    <li>User feedback and experiences</li>
                    <li>Product specifications and features</li>
                    <li>Value for money considerations</li>
                    <li>Overall quality and reliability</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We only recommend products that we genuinely believe will provide value to pet owners looking for
                    tracking solutions.

                <h2>Affiliate Programs We Participate In</h2>
                <p>We may participate in affiliate programs with various companies, including but not limited to:</p>

                    to evaluate the best products and services for our readers.

                    Our product selection process is independent of our affiliate relationships. We choose products to
                    review based on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Popular demand and reader interest</li>

                    information
                    current, but prices may vary between the time of writing and your visit to the retailer's website.
                    Always
                    check the current price and availability on the retailer's site before making a purchase.

                <p>
                    We are committed to providing honest, unbiased reviews and recommendations. If we have a negative
                    opinion
                    about an affiliate product, we will share it honestly. Our goal is to help you make informed
                    decisions
                    about pet tracking devices, not just to earn commissions.
