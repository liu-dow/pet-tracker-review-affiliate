  \ naturally more independent and agile than dogs, which means they need specially\
  \ designed pet trackers that won't interfere with their natural behaviors.</p>\n\
  \n<h3>Key Differences for Cat Trackers</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Weight:</strong>\
  \ Must be under 35 grams to avoid discomfort</li>\n  <li><strong>Size:</strong>\
  \ Compact design that won't get caught on objects</li>\n  <li><strong>Breakaway\
  \ collar compatibility:</strong> Essential for safety</li>\n  <li><strong>Indoor/outdoor\
  \ versatility:</strong> Many cats are indoor-only</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Best Features\
  \ for Cat Owners</h3>\n<p>When shopping for a cat tracker, prioritize these features:</p>\n\
  \n<h4>Lightweight Design</h4>\n<p>Cats are sensitive to weight on their collars.\
  \ Look for trackers that weigh less than 35 grams to ensure your cat's comfort.</p>\n\
  \n<h4>Activity Monitoring</h4>\n<p>Many modern cat trackers include activity monitoring\
  \ to help you understand your cat's daily patterns and health.</p>\n\n<h4>Safe Zone\
  \ Alerts</h4>\n<p>Set up notifications when your cat leaves designated safe areas,\
  \ perfect for monitoring outdoor cats.</p>\n\n<h3>Installation Tips for Cats</h3>\n\
  <p>Getting your cat used to wearing a tracker requires patience:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Introduce\
  \ the collar gradually over several days</li>\n  <li>Use treats and positive reinforcement</li>\n\
  \  <li>Ensure the collar fits properly - you should be able to fit two fingers underneath</li>\n\
  \  <li>Always use a breakaway collar for safety</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\
  <p>The right pet tracker can provide peace of mind for cat owners while ensuring\
  \ their feline friend's comfort and safety. Take time to choose a model specifically\
